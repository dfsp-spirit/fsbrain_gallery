# fsbrain_gallery
Example output of fsbrain. Contains comparably large media files (animations, images) for the website.

Ignore this repo, all its contents is linked from the [README of the fsbrain repo](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain), read that instead.

The files in here are stored in a separate repo to reduce the download size when cloning [fsbrain](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain). See the [fsbrain repo](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain) for the license for these files.
